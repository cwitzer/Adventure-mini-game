Summary:
  I created a mini 2D adventure game with a straightforward structure featuring two-option answers. At the beginning of the game, the player can choose between two paths, each with its-    own mini-story with both coming to the same ending.
  Developing the game took about four and a half weeks, as I was also working during this period, which meant I couldn't focus all my attention on it.

What I Learned:
  I learned the basics of game structuring and how to import sound effects and background music. The development process taught me to stay disciplined, learn from my mistakes, and   continue improving.
  Learning to better problem solve, asking the main questions: What happend, Why it happen , How to fix it. My main goal with this was to learn more about python and coding itself. Learning to code specially this project showed me how mentally draining coding is and how it's important to really understand what you are coding.
